## Basic React Project Folder Structure:

1.  Separate Components Folder:

- Place components in a dedicated folder(e.g., src / components).
- Organize related components into subfolders for better organization.

2. Assets Folder:

- Create an assets folder(e.g., src / assets) for static resources like images, styles, and fonts.

3. App Entry Point:

Keep the main application file(e.g., src / App.js or src / index.js) at the root.

## Intermediate React Project Folder Structure:

1. Pages Folder:

- Introduce a pages folder(e.g., src / pages) for higher - level components representing pages in the application.

2. Services or API Folder:

- Consider a dedicated folder(e.g., src / services) for API calls and services.

3. Utilities Folder:

- Group utility functions or helper modules in a separate folder(e.g., src / utils).

4. Styles Folder:

- Organize stylesheets in a folder(e.g., src / styles).
- Follow a naming convention or methodology(e.g., BEM) for consistency.

## Advanced React Project Folder Structure:

1. State Management:

If using Redux or another state management solution, organize actions, reducers, and selectors into separate folders.

2. Routing:

- If using React Router, consider a routes or navigation folder to manage routing configuration.

3. Configurations:

- Create a config folder for configuration files(e.g., environment variables).

1. Internationalization(i18n):
For multilingual projects, introduce an i18n folder to manage translation files.

2. Tests:
Organize tests into a tests or __tests__ folder.
Follow a naming convention that links test files to the components they test.

3. Storybook:
If using Storybook for component development, create a storybook folder.

4. Build Configuration:
Keep build configurations(e.g., webpack) in a config or build folder.

5. Mock Data:
If using mock data during development, store it in a mocks or fixtures folder.

6. Shared Components:
For components used across multiple features, consider a shared or common folder.

7. Higher - Order Components(HOCs) and Hooks:
Group HOCs and custom hooks in dedicated folders(e.g., src / hocs and src / hooks).

8. Documentation:
If applicable, maintain documentation in a docs folder or use a documentation tool like docz.

## Best Practices for All Levels:

1. Consistent Naming Conventions:
Adopt a consistent naming convention for files and folders(e.g., camelCase or kebab -case).

2. Modularization:
Break down large components or features into smaller, reusable modules.

3. Comments and Documentation:
Add comments and documentation where necessary, especially for complex logic or non - trivial components.

4. Package Management:
Keep dependencies organized in a clear and concise package.json file.

5. Version Control:
Use a version control system like Git and include a.gitignore file.

6. Code Formatting:
Enforce a consistent code style using tools like ESLint and Prettier.
